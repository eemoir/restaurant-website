# Pizza Restaurant Website  

This is my code for a pizza restaurant website (inspired by <a href="http://www.pinocchiospizza.net/">Pinocchio's Pizza and Subs</a> in Cambridge, MA), which uses a Django backend, a JS frontend, and a SQLite database. Users can register, log in, place an order, view their past orders, and resubmit orders.
